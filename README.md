# Feature-Transformation-Clustering---Prediction
In this script, K-means and GMM clustering is applied for Voice Recognition and GPU Run Time prediction. The features are transformed using LDA, PCA and Randomized Predictions. The cluster results before and after the clustering are then used as features for prediction through an Artificial Neural Network,
